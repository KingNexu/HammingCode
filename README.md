# HammingCode

## This is one of my first ever written pieces of software. 

I started exploring the world of coding in 2019 with small code examples in Python etc.
A few week's after that, I stumbled on one of the earliest methodes of "self correction" math.

I read everything I could about this topic and than in 2020 3Blue1Brown actually realeased a Video about this topic. This grabbed my attention again and I started working on the HammingCode.

### Disclaimer
As the source code was written in the beginning of my coding jurney you may notice some "dirty" coding habits.
